system: Hey, I am a chatbot for women. How can I help you?
women: My period is late. May I know what the reason is?
system: If your period is late, there could be various reasons for it, including stress, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances, changes in diet or exercise, certain medications, thyroid issues, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), pregnancy, or other underlying health conditions. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a gynaecologist or primary care physician, who can evaluate your individual situation, medical history, and any symptoms you may be experiencing.

woman: A guy is harassing me. Is there anything I can do about it?
system: First, stay calm and don't respond to the harasser. Comebacks from stalkers will only increase their level of anger and hatred towards you. \n\n Second, block, mute, and report the harasser. Do this mercilessly and instantly. \n\n Then, let your friends know and also tell them to block, mute, and report the harasser to the local police. Also, call the women's helpline number, 1091.

Women: Who is the president of the United States of America?
system: I think this question doesn't have to do with women or helping women get better. It might be best to ask this question somewhere else instead. ðŸ˜Š
